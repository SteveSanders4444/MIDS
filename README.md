# Berkeley MIDS Course Work

## W200 Python for Data Science *
Work in progress

## W201 Research Design and Application for Data and Analysis
The first course of the program is a gentle introduction to data science.  
We discussed the meaning of data science and think of potential projects (imaginations run wild).  
We also learned about interacting with other teams that may be unfamiliar with data science.  
No technical/hard skills covered in the course.  

## W203 Statistics for Data Science


## W205 Storing and Retrieving Data


## W207 Applied Machine Learning


## W209 Data Visualization and Communication


## W231 Behind the Data: Humans and Values *
Work in progress

## W241 Experiment and Causality
The course covers experiment design, and how to measure effects and identify causality, concepts critical for A/B testing.  
Our final project is an experiment examining how positive/negative reinforcement can affect self-confidence.  
**Amazon Mechanical Turk** and **Qualtrics** are used for the online survey.  
The analysis (as well as other assignments) is done in R.  
The final report can be found [here](https://github.com/jimscchen/MIDS/blob/master/W241/W241FinalReport.pdf).

## W251 Scaling Up! Really Big Data *
Work in progress

## W261 Machine Learning at Scale


## W266 Natural Language Processing
The course covers common NLP tasks and relevant tools (neural net/tensorflow, dynamic programming).  
All work is done in python, using a mixture of **google cloud** and PC.  
We learned and built Kneser-Ney, LSTM-RNN language models, Forward-backward, Virtebi and CKY algorithms.  
Our final project is an open information extraction and information retrieval system on marvel movie transcripts.  
The report can be found [here](https://github.com/jimscchen/MIDS/blob/master/W266/w266_final_project_report_jim-rohan-winston.pdf).


## W271 Statistical Methods for Discrete Response, Time Series and Panel Data*
Work in progress

## W210 Synthetic Capstone
Putting the learning together in a [data science project](http://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/intensive_capstone_unit/) (done in python).  
We developed a predictive model for **ICU readmissions** based on **MIMICIII** data set.  
We also built a front end to display important information and trends to help the doctors visualize patient data.  
The asynch content for the course touches on data projects and products, as well as some team dynamics.  
Over all the asynch content is a bit fluffy and overlaps with parts of W201.
